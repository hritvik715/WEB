// Template strings, also known as template literals, are a feature in JavaScript that allows you to create strings with embedded expressions. They are denoted by backticks `` instead of single or double quotes. Template strings provide a more flexible and concise way to construct strings, especially when they involve variables or expressions.


console.log(`hello`);
console.log(`this is 
    what`)


console.log(`${2 + 2}`);
